# SYNAPSE
A model to read the human mind

This is a project which uses machine learning to read stimuli from brain scans.

This data is of a subject looking at numbers 0-9 while brain scans are taken of them.
The model then learns this data to indentify which number the subject is looking at.

This project was made for the 2025 BT Young Scientist and earned me 3rd place in the Technology Category.
